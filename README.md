Hello Young Grasshoppers

I am an Audio Engineer and I love video games, anime and computer animation. 
I like to watch Full Metal Alchemist, Attack On Titan, My Hero Academia, Death Note, Samurai Champloo and much More!
Two of my favorite video games of all time are the Metal Gear Solid Series and The Last Of Us.
